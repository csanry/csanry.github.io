## üìä Data

This dashboard ingests data gathered from [OkCupid]{:target="_blank"} profiles from 2012.
Numerical columns were cleaned and grouped into bins to better understand their distribution. Histograms were subsequently generated to visualise these distributions.
The original dataset contained several fields which numerous categories. To faciliate visualisation, low frequency categories were combined to present the data in a clearer manner.
