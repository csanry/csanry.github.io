## Introduction

Loki is a tool to rapidly transform your BQ queries to DBT models and vice versa.

Use the loki CLI as part of your daily workflow to:

1. Convert a query written in `BQ` to a format suitable for `DBT` models
2. Convert `DBT` models back to `BQ` to facilitate troubleshooting in the BQ UI

## Overview 

1. Get general help on commands

    ```python
    loki --help
    ```

2. Transform a file 

    ```python
    loki -f sql_file.sql --to-bq
    ```

3. The CLI tool features additional handy functions, such as syntax capitalisation, when converting between dialects

## Notes

Loki is a lightweight wrapper that only requires `python >= 3.8.1` and `click >= 8.1` to run.
