## Introduction

Loki is a tool to rapidly transform your BQ queries to DBT models and vice versa.

Use the loki CLI as part of your daily workflow to:

1. Convert a query written in BQ to a format suitable for DBT models
2. Convert DBT models back to BQ to facilitate troubleshooting in the BQ UI

## Demonstration




## Overview

Loki is a lightweight wrapper that only requires `python >= 3.8.1` and `click >= 8.1` to run.
