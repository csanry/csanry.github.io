## üö© Goal

> Buying (or at least, trying to buy) a flat built by the **Housing Development Board (HDB)** is a common headache faced by many Singaporeans. 

As choosing a HDB flat is a major financial decision for many, it is crucical to understand the trends and factors that influence HDB valuations to make as informed of a choice as possible. 

This dashboard aims to serve as a comprehensive and intuitive tool to explore and analyse:
1. Trends in HDB prices and # of transactions from 2009 - 2019
2. Factors that significantly affect HDB prices


## üìä Data

Data for resale transactions from 2009 - 2019 was retrieved from [data.gov.sg]{:target="_blank"}, a public API repository of datasets related to Singapore.

Each row represents a unique transaction and includes details such as the `transaction_date` (representing the year and month when the transaction took place), `flat_type` (the type and size of the flat sold), `town` (district where the flat is situated), and `resale_price` (the price at which the flat was sold).

## üî• Features

**This dashboard is split into 2 main sections**
1. The left section focuses on the **number of transactions** over time 
2. The right section focuses on the **resale price of the flats**


**Global filters on flat types, year, and location**

To better understand trends in prices for different areas and flat types, users are able to use the filter options at the top section to select a subset of data.

**Visualising transactions by district over years**

The geographical map showing the breakdown of prices by district features an animation which allows the user to loop through and view changes in metrics over time.

**Interactivity**

In addition to presenting 5 number summaries in the boxplots in the right region, users are also able to interact with the charts to either filter down the data, or to view individual transactions.
