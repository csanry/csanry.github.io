# Welcome to my website 

The main purpose of this space is to provide a quick, centralised repository for my [`projects`](/projects/), [`posts`](/blog/), and [`resume`](/resume/).

I have a passion for sharing my personal growth and learnings in data and machine learning; some of my more recent interests include learning `Rust` and `PySpark`.

I can be contactable via email @ [`clarence.san@foodpanda.com`](mailto:clarence.san@foodpanda.com) or [`linkedin`](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarencesan/).
