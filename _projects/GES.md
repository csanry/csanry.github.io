## üö© Goal

> The Graduate Employment Survey is a yearly initiative by Singapore's 6 autonomous universities to assess employment outcomes from their graduating cohorts.

This dashboard aims to utilise the responses collected from the **Graduate Employment Survey** to understand:
1. How overall employment rates vary across universities, degrees, and years
2. Trends in salaries by universities, degrees, and years


## üìä Data

Data from the Graduate Employment Survey from the years 2013 - 2021 was retrieved from [data.gov.sg]{:target="_blank"}, a public API repository of datasets related to Singapore.

The survey is jointly conducted by **NTU, NUS, SMU, SIT (from 2014), SUTD (from 2015) and SUSS (from 2018)** annually to survey the employment conditions of graduates about six months after their final examinations. As a result, data points for SUTD and SUSS will not be available in the initial years.

**Yearly trends to identify changes over time**

Salary and employment rate percentages are colour coded by value so that the user is able to quickly identify the universities and degrees with the largest changes in these key metrics over the years.
